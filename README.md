## Development Notes

### Time Spent

Approximately 6 hours were invested in developing this application, including:

- Initial setup and configuration
- Component development
- API integration
- Testing and refinements
- Challenges Faced

#### The main technical challenge involved ensuring Ant Design compatibility with Next.js 14.

- POST requests return mock responses.
- A modal dialog was implemented for post creation.
- Ant Design components were used to ensure consistent styling.
